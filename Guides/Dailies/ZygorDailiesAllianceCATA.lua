Fight and defeat them
|tip The best strategy to defeat the Champion riders is to always make sure your shield is up by using your Defend ability.  Make sure your shield is stacked to 3 charges before you begin the fight.  When the fight begins, immediately use your Charge ability on the Champion rider (use your Shield-Breaker ability as you circle around to come back to the Champion rider, if possible).  Stay in very close range and spam your Thrust ability.  Remember to keep your shield maxed at 3 charges, also.  Eventually, the Champion rider will try to run away to get into Charge range.  When he starts to run away, start spamming your Charge ability until you charge him in the back (use your Shield-Breaker ability as you circle around to come back to the Champion rider, if possible), then get back into melee range and start spamming your Thrust ability again.  Keep repeating this process until he is defeated.

This is how this fight will happen:
|tip You will pull Chillmaw first and fight him until he is at about 75% health.  At that point, a Cultist Bombardier will spawn to help Chillmaw fight.  Kill the Cultist Bombardier IMMEDIATELY, as they do a lot of damage compared to Chillmaw.  Continuing fighting Chillmaw and 2 other Cultist Bombardiers will spawn: 1 when Chillmaw is at about 50% health, and 1 when Chillmaw is at about 25% health.  Again, kill the Cultist Bombardiers immediately when they spawn and this fight will be a fairly easy one.

Make sure your shield is stacked to 3 charges before you begin the fights.  When the fights begin, immediately use your Charge ability on the Boneguard Commanders (use your Shield-Breaker ability as you circle around to come back to the Boneguard Commanders, if possible).  Stay in very close range and spam your Thrust ability.  Remember to keep your shield maxed at 3 charges, also.  Eventually, the Boneguard Commanders will try to run away to get into Charge range.  When they start to run away, start spamming your Charge ability until you charge them in the back (use your Shield-Breaker ability as you circle around to come back to the Boneguard Commanders, if possible), then get back into melee range and start spamming your Thrust ability again.  Keep repeating this process until you kill 3 Boneguard Commanders.  Also, it may help you try to party with other players while doing this quest, as it will get done much faster and there are always other players in this area doing this same daily quest.
